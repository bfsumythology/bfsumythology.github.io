What do you know about greek/classical mythology? You know it's important. Everyone knows it's important. But why? How can stories created more than 2,000 years ago possibly influence your life? Just wait, you'll see. 
</p>
<p>
If you haven't yet been formally introduced to greek mythology, now is the perfect time! Allusions to Greek and Roman mythology are everywhere today. Look around you—billboards, museums, and libraries are just a few of the places that have welcomed the ancient myths. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps you think your only encounter with classical mythology so far was that stressful six-week crash course in high school followed by the traumatic final exam that held the power to make or break your GPA. But this isn't true. You have had a direct connection with mythology your entire life, regardless of whether or not you studied it in school. For instance, did you know that many names for plants and animals were taken directly from Greek and Roman mythology? These words we use every day help create that invisible link.
</p>
<p>
     There's no doubt about it; classical mythology surrounds us. Yes, it may be thousands of years old, but it is alive and thriving today. Though it is no longer considered a religion, mythology is useful in other forms. All mediums of Western art have incorporated the characters and scenes of classical mythology. Allusions are made by public speakers all the time. Movies, cartoons, and theater have all tried to capture the passion and drama of ancient myths. 
</p>
<p>
As you read through these captivating myths, consider their characters and scenes and then take a look around. Your eyes will be opened to the many colorful analogies and inside jokes present in today's world that pay tribute to the beliefs of an ancient world. This foundation will help to heighten your appreciation of all forms of Western art, including literature, sculpture, and even advertising. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, classical mythology also allows us a sneak peak into the everyday lives of the ancient Greeks and Romans. If you enjoy history, mythology is a fun and interesting way to learn about the culture, beliefs, and religious rituals of these peoples. Woven into the myths are clues as to how these people lived and what was important to them. 
</p>
<p>If you fancy science and origins, the myths are sure to intrigue you. You will find the meaning behind the names of planets, animals, constellations, and plants. Even today, we look to mythology to give names to our spacecraft such as Apollo, Mercury, and Zeus. The ancient Greeks and Romans used mythology to explain the mysteries of nature that weren't able to be explained using the technology of the day, providing an interesting look at how the ancients were able to answer those broad and fundamental questions that every society must answer. </p>
<p>
Classical mythology can be a pretty intimidating subject. It can be, but it doesn't have to be. What you have to keep in mind is that regardless of all the intellectual hoopla associated with Greek and Roman mythology, what it all boils down to are just good old-fashioned stories. And who doesn't love a good story? Consider classical mythology to be one huge book with hundreds of chapters nestled between its covers. Each chapter can stand alone as its own intriguing story or be combined with others to create one of the most awe-inspiring, fantastic tales ever told.
